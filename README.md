# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict resale prices of flats in Singapore using machine learning models. The dataset used in this project includes various features such as flat type, location, floor area, and others.

## Files Included
- **Data.zip**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
- **SingaporeResaleFlatPricesPredicting.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, xgboost, seaborn, matplotlib, etc. (Listed in requirements.txt if available)

## Instructions
1. **Data Extraction**: Extract `Data.zip` to access the dataset files.
2. **Environment Setup**: Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if available).
3. **Run the Notebook**: Open `SingaporeResaleFlatPricesPredicting.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute each cell sequentially.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains the dataset files (`data.csv`, `data_description.txt`, etc.).
- **SingaporeResaleFlatPricesPredicting.ipynb**: Main notebook with detailed code and comments explaining each step.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage
- The notebook guides through data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction.
- Adjust hyperparameters, try different models, or enhance feature engineering to improve predictions.
- Analyze evaluation metrics such as R-squared, MSE, MAE to assess model performance.
